# DeepBlock Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

## Overview

DeepBlock is a productivity app that helps you stay focused by blocking distracting websites at the DNS level. This privacy policy explains how DeepBlock handles your data.

## Data Collection

**DeepBlock does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

All data remains on your device:
- Your blocking preferences (groups, domains, schedules)
- Local usage analytics (focus time, blocked attempts)
- Subscription status (managed by Apple)

## DNS Queries

DeepBlock intercepts DNS queries locally on your device to determine which websites to block. These queries are:
- Processed entirely on your device
- Never logged, stored, or transmitted to any server
- Used only to apply your blocking preferences

## Local Analytics

DeepBlock stores usage statistics locally on your device:
- Daily focus time
- Number of blocked distraction attempts
- Focus score calculations

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not shared with any third party
- Can be deleted by removing the app

## Subscriptions

Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. DeepBlock does not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or Apple ID.

## System Extension

DeepBlock uses a DNS Proxy System Extension to intercept DNS queries. This extension:
- Runs locally on your device
- Does not route traffic through external servers
- Does not modify or inspect web traffic content
- Only checks if a domain should be blocked based on your preferences

## Third-Party Services

DeepBlock does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

DeepBlock does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

## Data Retention

All data is stored locally on your device. Uninstalling DeepBlock removes all stored data. There is no cloud backup or sync.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
